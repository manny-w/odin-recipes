        <h3>Authentic Jamaican Beef Patties</h3>
        <p>This Jamaican beef patty recipe makes delicious curry-flavored beef pastries popular in Jamaica and other Caribbean islands. Try serving them with peas and rice, or have them as a snack.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ground beef; season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.</li>
        </ol>
